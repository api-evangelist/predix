        "description": "Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is an algorithm to calculate an optimal match between two sequences which may vary in length.DTW originates from the speech regconition field and has been applied to batch process data.Due to the presence of batch-to-batch disturbance and physical constrains, the data sequences from batches may vary in length and unsynchronized.With DTW, data sequences from batches will be aligned to the same length and events taking place during each batch will be synchronized, then they are ready for further analysis. DTW plays a key role in process monitoring and optimization applications.",
